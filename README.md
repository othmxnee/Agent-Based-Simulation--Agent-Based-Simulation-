Agent-Based Simulation (Simple Infection Spread)

A simple Agent-Based Simulation built with Python and the Mesa framework.
Each agent moves randomly in a grid â€” if an infected agent meets a healthy one, the infection spreads instantly.
Recovered agents become immune.

Features:

Random agent movement

Simple infection and recovery logic

Step-by-step simulation in the console

Tech:

Python 

Mesa (Agent-Based Modeling library)

Run:

python run.py
